## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Resizes and normalizes input images.
- **Model Training:** Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn from a dataset of labeled animal images.
- **Prediction:** Classifies new images and outputs the predicted animal species.
- **Evaluation:** Assesses the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
